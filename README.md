## Python script utilizing Groq with Llama-3 for weather analysis


# Weather Analysis with Groq and Llama-3

This script uses the Groq service with the Llama-3 model to provide weather history and predictions. 
It takes a location as input and returns simulated weather data for the past 7 days and a prediction for the next 3 days.

## Requirements

Before running this script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installing Dependencies

To install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Setup
API Key:
You need a Groq API key. Place it in a `.env` file in the same directory as your script:
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
Environment Variables:
Use python-dotenv to load the API key from the .env file. Ensure dotenv is installed.

Usage
Running the Script:
Execute the script from the command line:
bash
python `weather_analysis.py`
You will be prompted to enter a location:
Enter Location: Kaduna
Output:
The script will output a** 7-day weather history and a 3-day weather prediction** to the console in table format.

Code Structure
input validation: Uses voluptuous for validating the location input.
Weather Query: Utilizes Groq's API with Llama-3 model to interpret weather queries.
Data Parsing: Currently includes a placeholder for parsing model responses; in a real scenario, this would involve more sophisticated text parsing.

Functions
`get_weather_query(prompt, model_name)`: Queries Groq with Llama-3 for weather information.
`fetch_weather_data(location)`: Fetches and processes weather data for the given location.
`parse_weather_response(response, days)`: A placeholder function to parse the model's text output into structured data.

Security Measures
API Key Management: The Groq API key is stored in environment variables, not in the script's source code.
Input Validation: Basic input validation to ensure the location input is within acceptable constraints.

Limitations
Simulated Data: The current implementation uses dummy data for both history and predictions. 
In a production environment, you would need to integrate with real weather APIs or improve the parsing of LLM responses.
Model Dependency: The script depends on the availability and performance of the Groq service and the Llama-3 model. If either changes, the script might need updates.

Future Improvements
Integrate with actual weather APIs for real data.
Improve the parsing logic for LLM outputs to handle real-world, unstructured data.
Add more detailed error handling and logging.
Implement data visualization for better user experience.
